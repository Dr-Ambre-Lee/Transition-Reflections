As a second year transition coordinator, the planning of the transition fair is as terrifying as even thinking about riding The Superman ride that used to be at Magic Mountain. The ride, which is closed (since 2025), had what was colloquially known as the ‘Drop of Doom.’

Maybe other people, meaning experienced and confident people, may not experience The Terror as I do each and every day. Possibly, my fear derives from the fact that I AM NOT A PLANNER OF LARGE (semi large) EVENTS. Secondly, there is not a How-to-Successfull-Pull-off-a-Transition-Fair guidebook. I’ve invited the vendors, educated the students on what to expect, created assignments, ordered food for the vendors and cookies for the students, assigned adult to different sections to help drive students to different vendors, invited parents, and I’m sure I’m forgetting something (or a lot of somethings).

All I can do now is hold my breath and show up.
