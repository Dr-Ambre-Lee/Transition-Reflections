After multiple internal arguments about starting a blog about transition and work, I've decided to commit. Full confession, starting a blog is not a problem; it's posting continuously that is the issue.

Possibly I never maintained a practice of posting because it often feels like you are writing into a void where the entire world disappears and it feels useless to continue if there are not readers. 

Readers don't matter is my new motto. In fact, this is freeing since I can now write for myself and truly be reflective of what I see in the field of transition.

The truth is, I've long believed that reflective pauses are vital for people in education, and yet I rarely take time to contemplate my practice. If I start an anologue journal, my writing vacillates between the professional and the personal (which is how life is at all times), but that does little to improve my abilities to effectively support students in their post secondary planning. Initiating a focused blog will help maintain my fidelity with reflection.

If you are here, welcome. I look forward to sharing this space with whomever slips down a rabbit hole and lands here.
