Last week, there were three lockdowns. THREE LOCKDOWNS. The kind of lockdowns where kids can’t leave the classroom to go to the bathroom. Adults can’t leave the classroom to go to the bathroom. Three days, Three Lockdowns. Emails go to staff and parents that out of an abundance of caution, the school is on lockdown. After 1.5 - 2 hours, another email is sent out-all clear. There is no viable threat.

What was the threat? Where did it come from? How do you know it’s not viable?

Rumors spread that it is a teen having fun. Another rumor spreads that it is AI generated. We are told that the same thing is happening to other schools, but nothing is ever in the news. If three lockdowns in one week are not reported in the news, did they happen?

On Thursday after school, I am working with a student. “I’m confused,” he said. “I’ve been lockdown free until now. I can’t tell the difference between the drills and what is real.”

His questions percolate until there are more questions. Like corn popping, he throws them at me. Later that night, I email mom to share some of his concerns. Schools don’t have a practice or protocol for debriefing students (and teachers) for re entry after a benign lockdown. Adrenaline and stress takes over the minds and bodies of students, whether the threat is ‘real’ or ‘not real’. 

It’s challenging to transition back into the school day and pretend nothing happened. Now, imagine doing that three days in one week.
