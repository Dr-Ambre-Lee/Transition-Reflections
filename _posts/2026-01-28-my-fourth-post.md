“Why won’t she do it when I am willing to sit right next to her and help?”

“Does he need to be reminded EVERY time to put a 4 part heading on his paper?”

“If they’ve done the assignment, why won’t they just hit submit?”

Reminders, planners, direct instructions, sometimes it doesn’t matter what supports are provided, some students will not use them. Since October 2025, I’ve been encouraging students to complete their FAFSA. 

“This is how you pay for school-college or trade school” I’ll say and each one smiles at me and swears they will do it. I have individual meetings with students and they promise to get it done. We schedule a follow up meeting the next month and SURPRISE! You guessed it, the FAFSA is not completed. 

Some students will ask me, “What is the FAFSA again?”

It is the end of January. The college and career counselors have agreed to help me out. They will provide sessions during the Transition Fair to help students navigate through the FAFSA. As I push out the sign up sheets, over 40 students have signed up!!!!!

Mysteries consist of secret rites practiced by select initiates. We can never fathom why students won’t do something, until someday, they will.
